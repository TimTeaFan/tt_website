<p>After college, I started out with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in „Philosophy and Economics“ at the University of Bayreuth (Germany). During my studies I have spent two and a half years in Japan as a research student. After coming back to Germany, I gained some work experience and then wrote my doctoral thesis (link) in economics. After that, I became a post-doc researcher on happiness economics in Japan.</p>

<p>Along my journey I have used many different tools for data analysis. From EViews (during my Masters in Japan) to Stata (as an econ post-doc) and occasionally R and SPSS.  However, it was not until my transition to a data science position that I started using R on a daily basis. This is where I discovered my passion for programming. Now, in my free time, I indulge in some recreational programming (mainly R Packages or dashboards) or answer questions on StackOverflow. I also have hobbies not related to computers such as making coffee as a home barista. I also used to go bouldering in the gym, but that was before Corona, and I am not sure when I will pick it up again.</p>
